        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>4-5 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Fresh mint and cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water or chicken/mutton stock</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
        <li>Whole spices (cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves) for tempering</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves) and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half for garnishing later.</li>
        <li>Add ginger, garlic, and green chilies to the pot. Sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biriyani masala. Cook until tomatoes are soft.</li>
        <li>Add chicken or mutton pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, and cilantro leaves. Cook for a few minutes until the meat is well coated with spices.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice to the pot and gently mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Pour in water or stock, season with salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid.</li>
        <li>Once done, fluff the biriyani gently with a fork. Garnish with fried onions, mint leaves, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita or salad on the side.</li>
    </ol>
